## 🎯 Two Testing Options

### Option 1: Test Locally (Same WiFi Only) ⚡

**How it works:**
Your friend visits your app on your computer's IP address.

**Requirements:**
- Your friend must be on the same WiFi
- Your dev server must be running

**URLs to share:**
- Korean: `http://172.100.100.84:3005/ko`
- English: `http://172.100.100.84:3005/en`

**How to start:**
```bash
cd C:\Projects\ocp-app
npm run dev
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Already working (no setup)
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Immediate

**Cons:**
- ❌ Only works on same WiFi
- ❌ Computer must stay on
- ❌ Can't test remotely

---

### Option 2: Deploy to Cloud (Recommended) 🌍

**How it works:**
Upload your code to GitHub, then deploy to Vercel for a public URL.

**Result:**
Your friend can access from anywhere: `https://ocp-app-xyz.vercel.app`

**Time needed:**
- 15 minutes (one time)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works anywhere (WiFi, mobile data, different cities)
- ✅ Always online (even when your PC is off)
- ✅ Professional setup
- ✅ Free for hobby projects
- ✅ Auto-updates when you make changes

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires GitHub + Vercel accounts (free)
- ❌ Initial setup time

**Quick steps:**
1. Upload code to GitHub
2. Connect Vercel to GitHub
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy
5. Update Supabase redirect URLs

- Git commands work in Command Prompt or PowerShell
- Environment variables are in `.env.local` (DO NOT upload to GitHub)
- Free tier limits are more than enough for MVP testing
